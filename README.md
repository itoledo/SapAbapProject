# PostgresDatabaseProject

Very simple Visual Studio extension to add a PostgreSQL database project to your solution. Inspired by the SQL Server Database Project extension, but for PostgreSQL.

It allows you to manage your database schema as code. Useful for version control, collaboration and for feeding your database objects to your AI minions. You can import an existing database schema into the project, and it will create a .pgsql file for each database object (tables, views, functions, etc.) in the project.
